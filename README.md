## Overview

This project gave me lots of experience. I used flexbox and CSS Grid together as the page layout. Maybe it wasn't necessary for this small project, but I needed to practice this special layout. Unfortunately, I couldn't get any comment on my work. For that, I checked other people's projects. It has been very useful for me. I compared some good projects with mine and commented on them. I think readable code is so important. Because if people don't understand your code, they cannot give any comments. Also, I should focus responsive design in a modern way. Because I don't want to use media property for every element. I saw some mobile-first design samples and it was amazing. It's such an easy way for responsive design. I'll upgrade the project this way within a few days.

## My Questions

> Hi everyone, I really spent a lot of time on this but I couldn't finish it, so I gave up... Maybe I should focus on some specific topics like responsive design... However, this project improved my coding skills a lot. I feel that.
>
> I have two problems here: 1 - How can I make this project responsive? Should I change every element or just some container elements? I couldn't understand it.
>
> 2 - How can I use .svg files as a background image? This topic is totally new for me. I checked some resources on the internet but I don't understand them.
>
> Until I finished my code, I changed my main structure a lot. I still have a problem with my nested structure and class names in HTML.
>
> I'll wait for some good responses from the community like my first project. They're so beneficial to me. Thank you so much.

## Feedbacks

**1. Grace Snow:**  
I hope this helps a bit  
remove all the headers article/ sections. You're misusing them. Better to focus on the important parts of html semantics: heading order and choosing the right interactive elements
the component should not have a width or height, only a max-width
font size must never very be in px. Use rem
use cover or contain for background size instead of px values
mobile styles should be the default. There actually isn't much that needs to change in a madia query on this. I think it's only the padding on the card content.
