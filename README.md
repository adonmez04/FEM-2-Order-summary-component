## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM Notation

### What I learned

This project gave me lots of experience. I used flexbox and CSS Grid together as the page layout. Maybe it wasn't necessary for this small project, but I needed to practice this special layout. Unfortunately, I couldn't get any comment on my work. For that, I checked other people's projects. It has been very useful for me. I compared some good projects with mine and commented on them. I think readable code is so important. Because if people don't understand your code, they cannot give any comments. Also, I should focus responsive design in a modern way. Because I don't want to use media property for every element. I saw some mobile-first design samples and it was amazing. It's such an easy way for responsive design. I'll upgrade the project this way within a few days.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
